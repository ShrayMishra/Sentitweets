# Sentitweets

Sentitweets is an independent project which analyses tweets from any user on Twitter. It fetches last 200 tweets for the given user and computes the tweet polarity using TextBlob. It further analyses various components of tweets like medium of tweeting, tweet length, most favourites, and most retweeted tweets and presents the graphical results.

Libraries Used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Tweepy, TextBlob.

Future Scope:
- Increase in the number of fetched tweets from 200 to 3200.
- Implementation of machine learning to improve the prediction of tweet polarity.
- GUI creation for better user experience.
